# DSE302-Project-Identification-of-Exoplanet-Orbitals
Since the detection of the first exoplanet in 1995, the quest for habitable exoplanets has become a pinnacle of research in Astronomy.  An Exoplanet is a planet outside our solar system. Knowledge of Orbital properties helps significantly in classifying the exoplanets as habitable planets. The objective of the project was to use machine learning to prepare a regression model that can predict the semi-major axis of exoplanet orbit using the data provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
